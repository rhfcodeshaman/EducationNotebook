# About this Notebook
This is a notebook for educating yourself in copmuter science and tech fields utilizing roadmaps.sh suggested education. It is currently set up for DevOps and AI & Data Science education with Python and Java as the languages for DevOps. There are currently no education notes, only roadmaps notes.

# Using this Notebook
Each directory in this notebook has a specific purpose. Below are their descriptions.

## 1. Learning Logs
This section is where your daily note will be created using the Obsidian Templates Core Plugin. Log your daily work in each note and fill out the attribute fields. This will generate data for other directories. Use the directory note to track hours spent as well as motivation to know when you need to ease off the gas.

## 2. Projects
Store projects you are working on here. Use #activeproject when making a project note(it will automatically be placed from the template) and placed it in 2_Projects/Active and change it to #finishedproject when you move it to the Complete directory.

## 3. LeetCode
This directory is used to store your work on LeetCode. The directory note tracks problems solved and time spent from your daily notes in 1_Learning Logs.

## 4. Self-Tests
This directory note generates a list of subjects you have worked on in the past week. Create notes in this directory for a weekly test on the subjects you have worked on.

## Area Directories
This notebook currently has Area Directories for AI & Data Science and DevOps. The directory note of these is a roadmap built using roadmaps.sh. Not all subjects are mapped out yet, but using Devops/1_Programming as an example, you create a sub-note, and then link it from the roadmap note. 

If the subject is broad(like Python), create another note from the Roadmap Template. Once you have hit a smaller area(your choice entirely how small you want), use the Subject Note to start taking actual 'class notes'. Make sure you are logging the lowest level of subject in your Daily Note to get accurate testing data.

## Zarchives
This directory contains the templates and any media you may attach such as images.
